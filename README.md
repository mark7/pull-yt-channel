Provides a list of YouTube channels, permits selecting one, and then
downloads the latest contents of those channels.  Avoids downloading
the same video multiple times.

Usage:

Copy example-pull-yt-channelrc to ~/.pull-yt-channelrc and modify it to reflect the list of channels that you want.  The first item is the directory location you want to place the downloaded videos.  The second is the type of video (as of this writing, 'youtube' for a playlist ID or 'youtube-all' for all videos by a user).  The third is the ID -- either the username of the YouTube user or the playlist ID (can be copied from the Youtube playlist page URL).
